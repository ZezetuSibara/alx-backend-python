0x00-python_variable_annotations

0. Basic annotations - add
0-add.py contains a type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float..

 1. Basic annotations - concat
1-concat.py contains a type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string.

 2. Basic annotations - floor
2-floor.py contains a type-annotated function floor which takes a float n as argument and returns the floor of the float.

 3. Basic annotations - to string
3-to_str.py contains a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float n as argument and returns the string representation of the float.

 4. Define variables
4-define_variables.py contains a script that define and annotate variables with the specified values.

5. Complex types - list of floats
5-sum_list.py contains a type-annotated function sum_list which takes a list input_list of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.

 6. Complex types - mixed list
6-sum_mixed_list.py contains a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list which takes a list mxd_lst of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

 7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple
7-to_kv.py contains a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int OR float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v and should be annotated as a float.

 8. Complex types - functions
8-make_multiplier.py contains a type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by multiplier.

 9. Let's duck type an iterable object
9-element_length.py contains an annotation of the function's parameters and return values with the appropriate types.

11. More involved type annotations
101-safely_get_value.py contains a script that includes the code below with type annotations added to it.

12. Type Checking
102-type_checking.py contains the code below and uses mypy to validate it and apply any necessary changes.
